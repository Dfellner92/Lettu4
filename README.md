This wasn't an easy assignment and I'll admit right away it isn't complete. 

What i think i did right: 

add a click function to the begin button
render the question and the timer
update the question and answer choices after a click
subtract time for a penalty

what i couldnt do:

have the timer begin an end game function once the timer runs out or if all the quiz questions are answered.
store the results in a list with the JSON language
